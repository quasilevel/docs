## Purpose of this document
The purpose of this document is to specify the roles, duties and operations of the Editorial subgroup created as the integration effort between English Club and PI Club. Henceforth, the Editorial group will be referred to as “the group” and the PI Club will be referred to as “the club”.

## Primary Functions
- Editing / Proofreading
  Documents of varying length will be provided to the group and it must proofread them to be free of errors pertaining to spelling, grammar, [tone and register.](/interanal/editorial_group_spec)
- Tone Correction
  Documents of varying length will be provided to the group along with a description of the intended audience, and the group must perform any tone correction needed to make the document’s language fit for the audience.
- Prompt based Creative Writing
  The club will provide a base prompt to the group and it must write a short to the medium length material in response. For example, the prompt may be “Write a short text to solicit responses from the students through the survey links”.

## Interfacing
This section describes how the group and the club will collaborate. This process is amendable in favor of a more efficient and seamless process. The group is free to manage its work, internally, in whatever manner it pleases and the club will not interfere with its functioning.
At an high level, the interaction can be described as:
- Input:
  The club will provide the prompt and an appropriate base material.
- Output:
  The group then provides the final output along with a [proof of verification](/internal/editorial_group_spec) from the group’s instructor.
Going deeper, the group and the club interact through a club-initiated full duplex mode of communication, generalized as:
- Initiation:
  The club provides the prompt and the appropriate base material.
- Push to backlog:
  The group adds the work to their working backlog, and reports how long the club shall wait for the output.
- Clarification:
  The group can ask follow up questions throughout the process to improve their understanding of the prompt.
- Feedback:
  The group can provide working drafts, allowing the club to affirm the validity of the output material and/or give feedback.
- Handover:
  The group finally provides the output material along with a proof of verification from the group’s instructor, ending the interaction.

## Proof of Verification
The group must verify their work with their instructor and must provide proof that the output they are providing has been verified.
The format of this proof is intentionally unspecified.
