## Purpose of this document
These are the aesthetic guidelines to be followed during the creative process while working on any project or creating any artifact under the PI Club’s name.

These guidelines include the themes and principles to be kept in mind by the members of the PI Club.

## Ideological Guideline
Keep a minimalistic mindset.
  - [Read on Minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism)
  - “If something can be taken away without the loss of meaning, then it must be taken away”.
  - “Less is more”.
  - “Minimalism is not the lack of something; it is the perfect amount of something”

## Thematic Guidelines
  - Theme colors: Black & White.
  - Theme font: `Fira Mono` (but any monospace font may be used).
  - Theme principle: Material Design (M2 or any later version)
  - [Read on Material Design](https://material.io)
 
## Note
While these guidelines intend to bring consistency across the PI Club’s creative works, artistic explorations and innovations are strongly encouraged.
