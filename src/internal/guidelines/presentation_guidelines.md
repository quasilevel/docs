## Purpose of this document
These are the guidelines that are to be followed when creating a presentation for PI Club’s training sessions.

These guidelines are intended to provide:
- A framework for the presenter(s)
- Consistency across the artifacts produced

To still allow for artistic innovations, this document will impose minimal artistic restrictions within reasonable bounds.

Henceforth, the term artifact refers to the Presentation document produced by the presenter(s).

## Structure of this document
The guidelines are divided into four sections:

### Aesthetic
This section includes guidelines for the _visuals and look-and-feel_ of the artifacts.

### Structural
This section includes guidelines for the _structure_ of the artifacts.

### Contentual
This section includes guidelines for the _content_ of the artifacts.

### Functional
This section includes guidelines for _functions to be performed before, during and after artifact creation._

## Structural

1. First slide must always be the `title` slide:
      a. Must have the PI Club's logo.
      b. Must name the subject(s) covered:
           * Subject(s) must only be named in singular terms, for example, "html" or "react js".
           * Subject must not be termed as phrase(s), for example, "Getting started with web pages".
       c. Must include either the presenter's name or pseudonym:
           * If a pseudonym is used, it must be used consistently across all the artifacts produced by them.
       d. May include the date of creation.
2. Second slide must always be the `overview` slide:
       a. Must include the list of topics covered.
           For example, the overview for the subject "html" may include (but are not limited to):
	            - Origin & Usage
	            - Syntax
	            - Common Tags
	            - Nesting
## Contentual
1. The text should be brief and to the point.
2. Technical depth is discouraged unless justifiable.
3. Code examples (if any) must:
     a. Be in text format.
     b. Be hosted in a github repository.

## Functional
1. The Presentation slides must include links to further study material, including any github repository.
2. The artifact must be approved by the document maintainer.
3. The artifact must be stored online:
     * Local copies (digital/print) are discouraged.
4. A link to the artifact must be shared with the members through PI Club's discord server:
     * The artifact must be shared at least 1 day before the presentation
