## Purpose of this document
This document outlines how the membership works in the PI Club, the different types of non-members, and the ways in which membership can end.

## Non-members
These are the people who want to be a part of the club but are not recognized as the members of the Club and enjoy no benefit from the Club and can not partake in Club activities.
The following are the different types of non-members:
- **Wannabe,** This is a non-member that hasn’t yet taken part in the Club interview or has decided to drop out. This includes freshers who are yet to appear for the interview, and the students who have appeared in the interview but weren’t selected.
- **Guardian,** This is a former club member whose membership ended simply because they have cleared their first and second year exams.
- **Incomp,** This is a former club member whose membership was cancelled in accordance with [Quality Control](/internal/operational_outline)
Every Non-Member, except for the Incomp, is eligible to be a part of the club.

## Members
These are the people who are recognized as a part of the club and enjoy all the incubation benefits that the club provides.

The membership is granted at the Club’s discretion after the Wannabe appears for the Club interview.

All members have the right to drop their membership, making them a Wannabe.
Any member’s membership can be canceled in accordance with Quality Control, making them an Incomp.

The membership lasts till the member makes it to third year, upon which, their membership ends naturally, making them a Guardian.

## The President
The president is the only member of the club whose membership doesn’t end after reaching third year. In fact, only a third year student can be the Club President.
