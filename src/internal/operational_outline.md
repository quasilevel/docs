## Purpose of This Document
This document outlines:
1. How the PI Club itself will operate.
2. How the members of the PI Club are expected to operate.
3. How contributions from non-members are going to be handled.

## Key Takeaways
1. The Club simply functions as an incubator.
2. All Club activities are effectively optional.
3. All members are expected to produce and/or improve working projects under the Club.
4. For Quality Control purposes, Members are awarded hidden points for their activities.

## PI Club’s operations
The Club’s primary purpose is to create an environment for the better programmers, giving them a space where they can spend time working on projects of their choosing.

The Club is neither a substitute nor an alternative to academic studies and self-studies. Rather, it acts as an incubator where members can freely grow and share their knowledge and work experience.

The Club’s primary operations are:
1. Performing managerial tasks such as, reporting to/from higher level    management (currently the HOD and the Director).
2. Facilitating and getting approval for the use of college equipment on behalf of the members.
3. Looking for project opportunities and providing them to interested members.
4. Nourishing and empowering member initiated projects.
5. Helping members to properly document their projects.
6. Holding KBE sessions (Knowledge Base Expansion sessions) wherein certain members can share knowledge from their interest domain (like, AIs, Robotics, Web Dev, OS Dev, etc)

## Expectations from Members
The members are primarily expected to work on projects. The scale and domain for these projects is unspecified, and members are free to work on projects of their choosing.

Members are also expected to conduct KDEs and complete tasks that have been assigned to them.

NOTE: Since these are only expectations, they are effectively optional.

## Handling of Contributions from Non-members
Contributions from non-members are encouraged and welcome. Non-members can contribute in the following ways:
1. Make suggestions, such as:
     * Improvements to the website.
     * Ways to make the club more inclusive.
     * General improvements.
2. Find bugs in the projects run by The Club and open issues on the Club’s  github.
3. Send code contributions to the projects as PRs (pull requests).
This list is not exhaustive in any manner.

## Quality Control
To ensure the Club produces quality, a Quality Control Mechanism is devised. This Mechanism is intended to naturally maintain quality without intervention from the Club.
The mechanism works as follows:
 1. Every member has a certain number of points.
 2. These points are hidden and the member will never know their exact number of points.
 3. At any moment, the membership of the member with the least number of points will be canceled.

NOTE: Points are always increased, and there’s nothing a member or anyone else can do to decrease them.

The following acts increases points for the members:
1. Initiating a project & finishing it.
2. Closing issues on projects.
3. Finding bugs and opening meaningful issues in projects not owned by themselves.
4. Making contributions to projects.
5. Collaborating on projects.
6. Conducting KBEs.
7. Completing assigned tasks.

Each act carries a different weight of points, however, the actual number will never be made public.
